In Builelib, calculations are performed by entering room geometry, building envelope and equipment specifications into an input sheet (Excel format) and uploading it.

- The same input sheet (xlsm file) used in the energy performance calculation program based on the Japanese Building Energy Efficiency Standards (WEBPRO) can be used.
- By adding a Builelib-specific special sheet (Form SP) to the WEBPRO input sheet, you can specify detailed calculation conditions and execute the calculation.

- Special sheet sample: [Builelib_inputSheet_sample_002.xlsx](https://github.com/MasatoMiyata/builelib/blob/master/sample/Builelib_inputSheet_sample_002.xlsx)

### How to Create Input Sheets

- For basic instructions on how to create the input sheet, please refer to the PDF manual titled *"Input Manual for the Energy Consumption Performance Calculation Program (Non-residential version)"*, available on the [official program website](https://building.lowenergy.jp/).
- To run calculations using the Builelib-specific special sheet, you must generate the special sheet within the WEBPRO input file (Excel file) by using the "Move or Copy" function to add the sheet.
