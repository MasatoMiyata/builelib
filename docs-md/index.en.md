# Builelib: Building Energy-modeling Library

**Builelib** (Builelib: Building Energy-modeling Library) is a program for calculating the energy consumption of non-residential buildings.

- Builelib: [https://builelib.net/](https://builelib.net/)

The calculation logic is based on the energy performance calculation program defined by the Japanese Building Energy Efficiency Standards (WEBPRO), but Builelib also includes several additional features not found in WEBPRO.

By uploading the WEBPRO input sheet (xlsx file), you can download a ZIP file containing the input files and calculation results.

By adding a special sheet for Builelib (SP sheet), more advanced calculations can be performed, such as changing the primary energy conversion factor or conducting coupled calculations between HVAC and lighting systems.
